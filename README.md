# PICOLO

## What is this?
PICOLO is Pick a Color

## Motivation
There are many difficulties with the paints that are currently used to draw pictures. First, the paints on the market are confined to limited colors, and the process of mixing them to create new colors with these colors is complicated. Also, there is no tool to pick around the colors, making it difficult for the user to create the desired color.

## Project Goal
The desired color is inputted from the user and it is easier to extract the difficult-to-mix paint. The color input function is developed by four methods such as RGB color selection, RGB color sensor scan, keypad input, and image pixel selection. The color output function is realized through servo motor and Rack & Pinion.
